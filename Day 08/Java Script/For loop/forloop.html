<h2>JavaScript For Loop</h2>
<p id="demo"></p>

<b>Explaination:</b>
<p>The for statement creates a loop with 3 optional expressions:<br>

for (expression 1; expression 2; expression 3) {<br>
  // code block to be executed<br>
}<br>
Expression 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.<br>

Expression 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.<br>

Expression 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.</p><br>
<p>From the example above, you can read:<br>

Expression 1 sets a variable before the loop starts (let i = 0).<br>

Expression 2 defines the condition for the loop to run (i must be less than 5).<br>

Expression 3 increases a value (i++) each time the code block in the loop has been executed.</p>
