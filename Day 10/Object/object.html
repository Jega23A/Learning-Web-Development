<p><b>Real Life Objects:</b><br>
In real life, objects are things like: houses, cars, people, animals, or any other subjects.<br>
Here is a car object example<br>
<p>Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.<br>
This code assigns many values (Fiat, 500, white) to an object named car.</p>
